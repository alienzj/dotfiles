**Hey,** you. You're finally awake. You were trying to configure your OS
declaratively, right? Walked right into that NixOS ambush, same as us, and those
dotfiles over there.

> **Disclaimer:** _This is not a "community framework" or "NixOS distribution"._
> Please do not use it like one. It is an ongoing and haphazard experiment to

> overly-opinionated hackery that make the other 9 circles of hell look like
> tropical beach resorts.
>
> Until I can bend spoons with my Nix-fu, please divert your general Nix(OS)
> questions [to the NixOS discourse][nixos-discourse] instead of my issue

## Quick start

1. Acquire or build a NixOS 24.05+ image:
   ```sh
   # Yoink nixos-unstable from upstream
   $ wget -O nixos.iso https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-unstable/latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso
   ```

2. Write it to a USB drive:
   ```sh
   # Replace /dev/sdX with the correct partition!
   $ cp nixos.iso /dev/sdX
   ```

3. Restart and boot into the installer.

4. Do your partitions and mount your root to `/mnt` ([for
   example](hosts/udon/README.org)).

5. Clone these dotfiles somewhere:
   ```sh
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles
   ```

6. Create a host config in `hosts/` (see [existing ones](hosts/) for examples).

7. Run the installer:
   ```sh
   # The options are optional, but these are their default values, if you omit them.
   $ dotfiles/install.zsh \
         --root /mnt \
         --flake /mnt/etc/dotfiles \
         --user "$USER" \
         --host "$HOST" \
         --dest /mnt/home/$USER/.config/dotfiles
   ```

8. Then reboot and you're good to go!

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to change your `root` and `$USER` passwords! They are set to
> `nixos` by default.

## Frequently asked questions

+ **Why NixOS?**

  Because managing a fleet of servers, a hundred strong, is the tenth circle of
  hell without a declarative, generational, and immutable single-source-of-truth
  configuration framework like NixOS.

  Sure beats the nightmare of brittle capistrano/chef/puppet/ansible/shell
  scripts I left behind.

+ **Should I use NixOS?**

  **Short answer:** no.

  **Long answer:** no really. Don't.

  **Long long answer:** I'm not kidding. Don't.

  **Unsigned long long answer:** Alright alright. Here's why not:

  - Its learning curve is steep.
  - You _will_ trial and error your way to enlightenment, if you survive the
    frustration long enough.
  - NixOS is unlike other Linux distros. Your issues will be unique and
    difficult to google. A decent grasp of Linux and your chosen services is a
    must, if only to distinguish Nix(OS) issues from Linux (or upstream) issues
    -- as well as to debug them or report them to the correct authority (and
    coherently).
  - If words like "declarative", "generational", and "immutable" don't put your
    sexuality in jeopardy, you're considering NixOS for the wrong reasons.
  - The overhead of managing a NixOS config will rarely pay for itself with 3
    systems or fewer (perhaps another distro with nix on top would suit you
    better?).
  - Official documentation for Nix(OS) is vast, but shallow. Unofficial
    resources and example configs are sparse and tend toward too simple or too
    complex (and most are outdated). Case in point: this repo.
  - The Nix language is obtuse and its toolchain is not intuitive. Your
    experience will be infinitely worse if functional languages are alien to
    you, however, learning Nix is a must to do even a fraction of what makes
    NixOS worth the trouble.
  - If you need somebody else to tell you whether or not you need NixOS, you
    don't need NixOS.

  If you're not discouraged by this, then you didn't need my advice in the first
  place. Stop procrastinating and try NixOS!

+ **How do you manage secrets?**

  With [agenix].

+ **Why did you write bin/hey?**

  I envy Guix's CLI and want similar for NixOS, whose toolchain is spread across
  many commands, none of which are as intuitive: `nix`, `nix-collect-garbage`,
  `nixos-rebuild`, `nix-env`, `nix-shell`, etc.

  I don't claim `hey` is the answer, but who doesn't like their own brew?

+ **How 2 flakes?**

  Would it be the NixOS experience if I gave you all the answers in one,
  convenient place?

  No. Suffer my pain:
